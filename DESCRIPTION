Title: Right Triangle Irregular Network Surface Approximation
Description: A vectorized implementation of the Right-Triangulated Irregular
  Networks (RTIN) surface approximation algorithm.  This implementation
  generates meshes that are triangulated subsets of maps, subject to error
  tolerances.  The vertices in the reduced mesh are also vertices in the
  original, and they are arranged to form right angle triangles.
